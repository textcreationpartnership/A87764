            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>Whereupon, <hi>June</hi> 16. His Majesty in like manner published Propositions to his Subjects for bringing in Money and Plate,<note place="margin">Why the King tooke up Arms. The kings War vindicatory and defensory.</note> to raise an Army, <hi>for recovering the Forts, Castles,</hi> Militia, <hi>and Navy; and for maintaining and defending his Negative Vote, and the Power of the Crown, in Law-making and Governing; and for defence and preservation of his Royall Person, Dignity, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And is not this to take up Armes <hi>for suppressing Rebellion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know there were severall other Propositions offered to his Majesty <hi>before and since</hi> the War; but I omit them,<note place="margin">The other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions why omitted.</note> because themselves doe not <hi>finally</hi> insist on them.</p>
               <p>And now what those Lords and Commons declared and proposed from the beginning, <hi>Against the King, and against the Crown the same in every particular doe they propose and demand at this day:</hi> as appeares by <hi>the new Propositions of Peace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Their Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at present are the very same as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; &amp; so the grounds and ends of their War are the same, Dec. 1647.</note>
                  <hi>and the four Bils sent to his Majesty at</hi> Carisbrook <hi>Castle,</hi> which we had not known but by the Answer of the <hi>Scots</hi> Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and they tell us,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Preface compared with other parts of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, <hi>takes away the Kings Negative Voice, and cuts off all Royall Power and Right in Law-making.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That they divest the King, his Posterity and the Crowne for ever of all Power and Right of the <hi>Militia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That they deprive the King of conferring <hi>Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> and of disposing of the <hi>great Officers of State,</hi> and the naming of <hi>Privy Counselours</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. that they take away <hi>the Court of wards,</hi> and <hi>Forrest Lands</hi> from his Maiesty.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That <hi>the Four Bils</hi> were as followeth,</p>
               <p n="1">I. For setling <hi>The</hi> Militia <hi>of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland in both Houses of Parliament, and for raising Money for Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance of Forces at Sea and Land, by the two Houses of Parliament.</p>
